Built-in queries
################

Queries for all languages I know have now been ported.

As of version 0.8.3 Neovim can only match one node per query.  This is a
limitation of Neovim and there is nothing that can be done on this end.


Queries which I cannot port
===========================

I do not know enough about the following languages in order to write good
queries.  Contributions are welcome.

- cuda
- dart
- devicetree
- elixir
- elm
- fennel
- fish
- gdscript
- graphql
- haskell
- hcl
- julia
- kotlin
- meson
