# nvim-ts-rainbow
Rainbow parens for neovim using tree-sitter. Needs [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
Tested languages - java, clojure, fennel, python. Should work with any language (except lua and bash and I don't know, something else too)

## Setup
```lua
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup {
  rainbow = {
    enable = true,
    disable = {'lua', 'bash'} -- please disable lua and bash for now
  }
}
```

### Colours
I've used the gruvbox palette because it is nice and subtle. I wanted to use VIBGYOR for an actual rainbow, but
 - indigo and blue look the same.
 - the colours were too bright and distracting.

To change the colours, edit `lua/rainbow/colors.lua` and commit your changes.
